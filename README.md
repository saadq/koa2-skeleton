1. Use the <kbd>Download Zip</kbd> button at the top right.
2. Run `$ git clone git@github.com:saadq/koa2-skeleton.git` in the command line.

Once you've downloaded the app, run `npm install` to get the necessary dependencies for the project.

### Starting the server
Once you have all your dependencies installed, you can run `npm start` to start the server and then you can head over to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
